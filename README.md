# FoundryVTT Scum and Villainy character and ship sheets

An attempt to adapt the Blades in the Dark system created by megastruktur to Scum and Villainy

## IMPORTANT NOTES

I've seen some reports of loss-of-data from the Notes fields on the character sheets, so please be careful with them.  If you can reproduce the behavior reliably, please let me know.

Also, I've occasionally seen item popups show up empty or missing class-specific items.  This may be a product of my frequent changes during testing, but if you see this, screenshot your sheet FIRST and try removing the Class/Ship Type, then re-adding it.  In a pinch, items can be added the old-fashioned way by dragging them from the relevant compendium.


## Recommended Modules

- Ernie's Modern UI
- Clocks
- DSN (with chrome dice!)


## Usage
`"Actor" - Universe (system/planet/faction trackers), ships, characters, clocks`
`"Item" - all classes, ship types, upgrades, items, abilities, etc.`

- 1st thing, create a Universe sheet to track systems, planets, and factions.  Click Update Systems and Update Planets to auto-populate the sheet with all available systems and planets.
- If, at a later date, you add a custom system/planet to your game, click the relevant update link again to bring it onto the sheet.
- Only currently relevant factions should be tracked, as the sheet will get huge otherwise.  If there's a strong need for a separate faction sheet, let me know.
- PLEASE NOTE that deleting a faction from the sheet will delete all associated status and job info.  Faction tiers are editable from the faction item sheet linked from the faction name.
- To reset reputation, exp, etc counters just click on the label name or the nearby 0 icon.
- To add items, you can click a corresponding label to bring up a popup containing all eligible items.
- All "class/ship" specific items are prefixed with first letters, but item lists on the character sheet should be correctly limited to the appropriate items.
- If you want/need to add an item that does not appear in the popup list (for example, adding a Veteran ability), just drag and drop it from the proper compendium.
- To see the description of Class, Vice, Background, etc you can just click added item and see all the info in the popup.
- When adding a new item you can hover over a "question-circle" icon to see the item's description.
- To add Custom abilities, items, systems, planets, factions, etc.,  just add a new "Foundry Item" of the corresponding type and fill all the necessary info. Then drag it to the sheet or add via button on a sheet.
- When editing/adding new abilities to the Ship sheet, if they have an effect on the linked Character sheets, you must unlink and relink the Ship to see the effects.
- BE CAREFUL removing items.  Any item removed from an actor sheet will lose all linked data and will have to be recreated.

Classes:
- (Me)  Mechanic
- (Mu)  Muscle
- (My)  Mystic
- (P)   Pilot
- (Sc)  Scoundrel
- (Sp)  Speaker
- (St)  Stitch

Ship Types:
- (S)  Stardancer
- (C)  Cerberus

## Clocks
- To add clock go to Actors tab and create a new Actor of type "ðŸ•› clock".
- To share it with other players just drag it to a scene.

## Logic field

Logic field is a json with params which allows to implement some logic when the Item of corresponding type is added or removed.
### Example (from the Vault 1 crew upgrade)
`{"attribute":"data.vault.max","operator":"addition","value":4,"requirement":""}`
- `attribute` - the attribute to affect
- `operator` - what is done to attribute
- `value` - the value for operator
- `requirement` - is not used

### Operators list
- `addition` - is added when item is attached and substracted when removed
- `attribute_change` - changes the "attribute" to value and when removed - uses the "attribute_default" to restore

## Troubleshooting
- If you can't find an item added to your sheet, refer to "All Items" tab on each sheet.
